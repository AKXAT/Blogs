A database is a systematic collection of data. Databases make data management easy. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data, also we can easily retrieve the required data from the database using certain techniques.

## Components of a Database:
- **Hardware** -> They are the physical devices or electronic devices to offer the interaction between the real-world and the computers 
- **Software **-> These are the set of codes or programs used to manage and control the database. These include the OS, Database software, networking software and other applications 
- **Data** -> Data is the key component of the database. It is referred to as a set of unorganised information which is needed to be processed to be meaningful.
- **Procedure** -> Set of rules that can be used to manipulate the database management system. 

## Types of Database ->
- **Centralised Database** -> In this type of database the data is stored in a central data system and the users from a different location can easily access the data. There are a lot of authentications and validations are required to access the data.
- **Distributed Database** -> We can call it just the opposite of what we saw in the centralised database. The Data is not at a single place, it is distributed at different locations.
- **Cloud Database** -> The data nowadays are stored in the virtual environment, public or private cloud. It also offers scalability on-demand, along with high availability.
- **Relational Database** -> The relationship between the data is defined in the form of tables. This is one of the most famous types of DBMS.
- **Personal Database** -> This one is created by the end-user for self/group. The data is mostly used by the same department of the company and is accessed by a small group of people. 
- **Object-oriented databases** -> In this type of database, we can store data of any type. The data is stored in the form of objects which will have its own attributes.
- **Commercial Database** -> These are just the paid version of a huge database designed for the users who want to access data for research.
- **NoSQL Database** -> It is used for larger set of distributed data. These type of database are very efficient in analyzing large-size unstructured data.
- **Operational Database** -> Data related to operations of an Industry is stored inside this type of database. Functional lines like marketing, employee relations, customer service etc. require such kind of databases.
- **Graph databases** -> This uses graph theory to store, map, and query relationships. These kinds of computers databases are mostly used for analyzing interconnections.
