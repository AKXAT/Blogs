### Why you need this?
There are so many topics -> **Array, Linked List, Stack, Queues, Searching, Sorting, Tree, Graph**…. Why do we need to learn all of this? Will, I ever use these in my life?

A lot of us even a few experienced programmers tend to skip on these topics. The one reason is that they find it to be a bit complicated and of no use in practical situations.


### Some examples of Data Structures in real life 
- The world-famous chess game will be using the **Tree** to store the possible moves 
- You want to go back to the old page you visited in the browser, there we make use of **Stack**
- You have to store social network “feeds”. we make use of **Hash table**
- To store the customer information in drive-in places we make use of **Queue**


There are lot many examples and these are just a few. You might have understood a little bit that why learning data structure and algorithm is important in real life

Data structures and algorithms play a major role in implementing software and in the cracking interviews as well. 

### What is Data Structure?

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

# How and where to start?

Ok, you got that, Data Structures and Algorithms are important and will always be a part of your life if you are into programming.
