## ü§î Context:

So recently I had project where our team had to build a Flask-React Application that would be used by other micro service developers to run automated test and perform analytics on same.

Once we were done with application we were give a VM to Deploy and run that App on.

Question Came , what to use?

## üåè What Options do we have ?

### ‚û´ Backend (Flask) Application Servers

| **Application Server** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gunicorn** | Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX | Easy to use with Flask, highly configurable, good performance | Limited to UNIX-like operating systems |
| **uWSGI** | Application server for deploying Python web applications | Very configurable, supports multiple languages, robust performance | Complex configuration, steep learning curve |
| **Nginx with uWSGI** | Nginx as a reverse proxy with uWSGI application server | High performance, efficient static file serving, load balancing | Complex setup, requires configuration for both Nginx and uWSGI |
| **Apache HTTP Server with mod\_wsgi** | Apache module for hosting WSGI applications | Mature and stable, integrates well with other Apache features | More complex setup, higher resource usage compared to Nginx |
| **Daphne** | HTTP, HTTP2, and WebSocket protocol server for ASGI and ASGI-HTTP | Supports WebSockets and HTTP2, integrates well with Django Channels | Not as mature as uWSGI or Gunicorn, more suitable for ASGI apps |
| **Nginx with Gunicorn** | Nginx as a reverse proxy with Gunicorn application server | Good performance, easy to set up, load balancing | Requires configuration for both Nginx and Gunicorn |

### ‚û¨ Frontend (React) Application Servers

| **Application Server** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nginx** | High-performance web server and reverse proxy server | Efficient static file serving, high performance, load balancing | Requires configuration |
| **Apache HTTP Server** | Versatile and widely used web server | Mature and stable, supports various modules | Higher resource usage compared to Nginx |
| **Vercel** | Platform for static sites and serverless functions | Easy deployment, built-in CDN, optimized for React | Limited to static sites and serverless functions |
| **Netlify** | Platform for web applications and static websites | Easy deployment, built-in CDN, continuous deployment | Limited backend capabilities, primarily for static sites |
| **Firebase Hosting** | Hosting for static and dynamic content with a global CDN | Easy to use, integrates well with other Firebase services | Limited to static content and serverless functions |
| **GitHub Pages** | Free hosting for static websites directly from a GitHub repository | Simple to set up, free for public repositories | Limited to static content, no backend support |

### üñ•Ô∏è Let's see How your Websites servers you with data.

> 9. **Nginx Sends Response to User's Browser**:
>     
>     * Nginx receives the response from the AWS web server and forwards it back to the user's browser.
>         
> 10. **Browser Renders Page**:
>     
>     * The browser receives the response from Nginx and starts rendering the homepage. It interprets the HTML, applies the CSS for styling, and executes JavaScript for dynamic content and functionality.
>         
> 11. **User Views Homepage**:
>     
>     * The user sees Amazon's homepage displayed in their browser. They can now interact with the website by searching for products, clicking on links, and navigating through different sections.

<mark>This is a very basic example. In reality, many additional components and processes are involved, such as load balancers, caching mechanisms, security layers, and more.</mark>

### üëæ How NGINX would help here ?

1. **Load Balancing:** As the **user base increases**, a single server may **struggle** to handle all requests simultaneously, potentially causing a **bottleneck**. To mitigate this issue, multiple servers can be deployed. However, the critical question arises: **how does each request determine which server to target**? This is where **NGINX** plays a crucial role. Users interact solely with **NGINX**, which is responsible for **balancing the load** across the various servers by distributing incoming requests effectively.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720717396750/e98c93da-1a49-4a47-b801-eb95a6438050.png align="center")
    
2. **Encryption:** Whenever you visit a website, you might notice that the URL starts with either **HTTP** or **HTTPS**. If it's **HTTPS**, it means that the data exchanged between the server and your browser is **encrypted**. On the user side, this data is **decrypted**. In scenarios with multiple servers, encryption needs to occur on each server. However, **NGINX** can handle this by managing the encryption process itself, ensuring that the data is encrypted and decrypted at the NGINX level.
    

There are several reasons to use NGINX and a reverse proxy, but here are the key considerations our team had in mind:

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èLet's get started...

## üíø Installation

The installation steps vary depending on your operating system. For Ubuntu/Debian, follow these steps:

**Update the package index:**

1. ```plaintext
       sudo apt update
    ```
    
2. **Install Nginx:**
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo apt install nginx
    ```
    
3. **Start Nginx:**
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```
    
4. **Enable Nginx to start on boot:**
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```
    
5. **Check Nginx status:**
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo systemctl status nginx
    ```
    

## üîé Verification

1. Once you have installed NGINX, you need to navigate to the directory where the configuration files are located. On a Mac, the NGINX files are typically found in `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx`.
    
    To do this:
    
    1. Open a terminal.
        
    2. Navigate to the NGINX configuration directory:
        
        ```plaintext
        cd /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx
        ```
        
    
    You can then open the configuration files using your preferred text editor. For example:
    
    * To open the directory in VS Code, use:
        
        ```plaintext
        code .
        ```
        
    * To edit files using `vim`, use:
        
        ```plaintext
        vim nginx.conf
        ```
        
2. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721486467890/655807d5-017d-4ca8-8132-b5e18d364003.png align="center")
    
    We will specifically be working on the `nginx.conf` file for configuring NGINX. However, for now, let's just start NGINX by running the following command:
    
    ```plaintext
    nginx
    ```
    
    If there are no errors, you can check the NGINX server by opening your browser and navigating to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080). You should see a default NGINX welcome page.
    
    To verify further, you can inspect the page in your browser:
    
    1. Open the developer tools (usually by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing `F12`).
        
    2. Go to the "Network" tab.
        
    3. Refresh the page.
        
    
    You should see the server details in the network tab.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721487553581/91a36110-c38e-4497-82b4-e347242cf842.png align="center")

## üìö Understanding

In configuration files like `nginx.conf`, individual settings are commonly referred to as **directives**. Directives are instructions or settings that control the behavior of the server. They are typically written as **key-value pairs,** where the key is the directive name and the value is the directive's setting or parameter.

Here's a breakdown of what these terms mean:

* **Directive**: An instruction that tells the server how to behave or configure a specific aspect of its functionality.
    
* **Key**: The name of the directive.
    
* **Value**: The parameter or setting for the directive.
    

For example, in the directive `worker_processes 1;` :

* `worker_processes` is the key (the name of the directive).
    
* `1` is the value (the setting for this directive).
    

In NGINX configuration files, directives can also be grouped into **blocks**. Blocks are enclosed in curly braces `{}` and can contain multiple directives. For example:

```plaintext
http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen       8080;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

* `http` is a block that contains several directives.
    
* `server` is another block within the `http` block.
    
* `location /` is yet another block within the `server` block.
    

Each block can contain multiple directives, and these directives configure different aspects of the server's behaviour.

## üìù Practice with an example.

1. I need you to delete the entire configuration in the nginx config file.
    
2. After that, create a new project directory and place an `index.html` file inside it. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see the `nginx.conf` file opened in VS Code on the left side, with its contents deleted. On the right side, I've created a sample directory containing the `index.html` file.
    
3. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721490698959/6889c50d-08b1-4e64-a6eb-6ef8984694cc.png align="center")
    
    Now, we will serve a static HTML page using Nginx. Create a simple HTML page, or you can copy the code provided below.
    
4. ```xml
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>Simple Website</title>
         <style>
             body {
                 font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                 margin: 0;
                 padding: 0;
                 background-color: #f4f4f4;
             }
             header {
                 background-color: #333;
                 color: white;
                 padding: 1em;
                 text-align: center;
             }
             main {
                 padding: 1em;
             }
             footer {
                 background-color: #333;
                 color: white;
                 padding: 1em;
                 text-align: center;
                 position: fixed;
                 bottom: 0;
                 width: 100%;
             }
         </style>
     </head>
     <body>
         <header>
             <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
         </header>
         <main>
             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>Hi there! I'm learning NGINX.</p>
             
             <h2>My Interests</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Coding</li>
                 <li>Blogging</li>
                 <li>Music</li>
                 <li>Skateboarding</li>
             </ul>
         </main>
         <footer>
             &copy; 2024 My Simple Website
         </footer>
     </body>
     </html>
    ```
    
5. Once done, let's write some blocks and directives to serve the `index.html` file.
    
6. ```nginx
     http    {
         server  {
             listen  8080;
             root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
         }
     }
     
     events   {}
    ```
    
7. Now let's see in detail.
    
    1. ### `http` Block
        
        The `http` block is used to define configurations related to handling HTTP traffic. This is where you set up your server(s) and specify how requests should be processed.
        
    2. ```nginx
         http {
             server {
                 listen  8080;
                 root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
             }
         }
        ```
        
    3. ### `server` Block
        
        The `server` block defines the configuration for a specific virtual server. In my case, I have a single server block within the `http` block.
        
        #### `listen 8080;`
        
        * **Purpose**: This directive tells NGINX to listen on port 8080 for incoming HTTP connections.
            
        * **Importance**: The `listen` directive is crucial because it specifies the port number on which the server will accept requests. Port 8080 is a common alternative to the default HTTP port 80, often used for development and testing purposes.
            
        
        #### `root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;`
        
        * **Purpose**: This directive sets the root directory from which files will be served for requests that match this server block.
            
        * **Importance**: The `root` directive is important because it tells NGINX where to find the files to serve. In this case, it points to the `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample` directory. This means that if someone accesses my server on port 8080, NGINX will serve files from this directory.
            
        
    4. ### `events` Block
        
        The `events` block is used to configure how NGINX handles connections at a lower level, such as setting the number of worker connections.
        
        ```nginx
        events {}
        ```
        
        * **Purpose**: Although I haven't specified any directives within the `events` block, it is required to be present in the configuration file. Typically, we would configure settings like `worker_connections` here, which defines the maximum number of simultaneous connections that each worker process can handle.
            
        * **Importance**: Even though it's empty, the `events` block is necessary for NGINX to function properly. It serves as a placeholder for potential future configurations related to event handling.
            
        
    5. Once Done , you will have to reload the nginx using the command `nginx % nginx -s reload` and then refresh the browser. You should be seeing the contents from the `index.html` page as below.
        
    6. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721492703891/2a95abc2-a5e3-459c-8bfc-74056a9bb5c9.png align="center")
        

# üëª Mime Types

Before we move on to understanding MIME types in Nginx, please remove the CSS components from the HTML file and place them in a `styles.css` file. Then link this CSS file in your HTML.

Your `index.html` should look like this:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm learning Nginx.</p>
        
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Blogging</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Skateboarding</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
    <footer>
        &copy; 2024 My Simple Website
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

and the `styles.css` should be.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
}

main {
    padding: 1em;
}

footer {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

Once Done , Reload the NGINX using the command `nginx -s reload` and refresh the browser.

You will notice that the CSS components are missing. All the colors and designs are gone, leaving just plain text. If you inspect and refresh the screen, you should see that `styles.css` is actually being served.

**The Reason for CSS not being loaded is the content type for css, which is text/plain.**

## **üß± HOW TO FIX THIS ?**

We can simply go to the config file of nginx and mention the types there which would represent for what type of file what is the extension. So now the config file should look like this.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">1. You will have to hard reload so that the cache is cleared. 2. We can simple add <code>include mime.types;</code> because the nginx comes with some default mime types.</div>
</div>

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721495016920/bad2bf53-f34a-4bad-9e44-2e2e45dc2753.png align="center")

MIME types (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) are a way of specifying the type of content being served by a web server. In NGINX, MIME types help the server understand how to handle and display different types of files. They tell the browser or client how to interpret the content of a file.

### üëâ What are MIME Types?

A MIME type is a standardized way of describing the nature and format of a file. It consists of a primary type and a sub-type, separated by a slash. For example:

* `text/html`: This indicates an HTML file.
    
* `image/jpeg`: This indicates a JPEG image.
    
* `application/json`: This indicates a JSON file.
    

### üëâ How NGINX Uses MIME Types

In NGINX, MIME types are used to set the `Content-Type` header in HTTP responses. This header tells the client what type of data is being sent. For example, if NGINX serves a file with the MIME type `text/html`, the browser knows to display it as an HTML page.

### üëâ Configuring MIME Types in NGINX

NGINX uses a file named `mime.types` to define mappings between file extensions and their corresponding MIME types. This file is usually included in the main configuration file (`nginx.conf`) with a directive like `include mime.types;`.

Here‚Äôs a simplified example of what the `mime.types` file might look like:

```nginx
types {
    text/html                             html htm;
    text/css                              css;
    text/javascript                       js;
    image/jpeg                            jpeg jpg;
    image/png                             png;
    application/json                      json;
    application/octet-stream              bin exe;
}
```

### üëâ Explanation

* `types { ... }` block: Defines MIME types and the file extensions that correspond to them.
    
* `text/html html htm;`: Tells NGINX that files with `.html` and `.htm` extensions should be served with the MIME type `text/html`.
    
* `text/css css;`: Files with the `.css` extension should be served with the MIME type `text/css`.
    
* `image/jpeg jpeg jpg;`: Files with `.jpeg` and `.jpg` extensions should be served with the MIME type `image/jpeg`.
    

### üëâ Why MIME Types are Important

1. **Proper Handling**: Ensures that files are handled correctly by the client. For example, a browser will render HTML files correctly only if they are served with the `text/html` MIME type.
    
2. **Security**: Helps prevent security issues by ensuring that files are treated as their proper types. For instance, serving a file with the wrong MIME type might result in it being executed or rendered incorrectly.
    
3. **User Experience**: Provides the correct content type to users, improving their experience. For example, ensuring images are displayed properly by serving them with the correct `image/*` MIME type.
    

# üìç Location Blocks

Let's say now you want to showcase all you coding projects and you created a separate HTML page for same. So I created a coding directory inside the Main Project Directory and inside the coding directory we have the index.html and css (which is same as the first page).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721574668074/24686094-476a-4180-b964-9cb7d797e62e.png align="center")

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Coding Projects</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>Weather Report</li>

```

Now the question is how to make sure if the user reaches for [`http://localhost:8080/coding/`](http://localhost:8080/coding/) the HTML page that we created above is showcased. Now this is something that Nginx can handle automatically , but if you want to specifically add the path we need to use **Location Block.**

Location blocks in NGINX are used to define how NGINX should process requests for specific URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) or paths. They are one of the most powerful features in NGINX configuration, allowing you to set different rules and behaviors based on the URL being accessed.

### üëâ What is a Location Block?

A location block is defined with the `location` directive, followed by a pattern that matches a URI. Inside the block, you can specify directives to handle requests that match the pattern.

### üëâ Basic Syntax

```nginx
location [modifier] pattern {
    # directives
}
```

* **modifier**: Optional. Determines how the pattern is interpreted.
    
* **pattern**: The URI pattern to match.
    
* **directives**: Instructions on how to handle the matched requests.
    

### üëâ Common Modifiers

1. **No modifier**: Performs a prefix match (default behavior).
    
    ```nginx
    location /images/ {
        # handles URIs starting with /images/
    }
    ```
    
2. `=` (exact match): Matches the exact URI.
    
    ```nginx
    location = / {
        # handles the exact URI "/"
    }
    ```
    
3. `~` (case-sensitive regular expression): Matches URIs using a case-sensitive regex.
    
    ```nginx
    location ~ \.php$ {
        # handles URIs ending with .php
    }
    ```
    
4. `~*` (case-insensitive regular expression): Matches URIs using a case-insensitive regex.
    
    ```nginx
    location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico)$ {
        # handles URIs ending with .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, or .ico (case-insensitive)
    }
    ```
    
5. `^~` (prefix match with higher priority): Matches the beginning of the URI and stops searching if this block matches.
    
    ```nginx
    location ^~ /static/ {
        # handles URIs starting with /static/ and stops further matching
    }
    ```
    

> ### üëâ Default Behaviour without Location Block
> 
> If no `location` block is specified, NGINX uses the default settings of the `server` block to handle requests. This means it will:
> 
> * Use the `root` directive to determine the base directory for serving files.
>     
> * Look for the `index.html` file in the requested directory.
>     
> * So, if you add a new directory with an `index.html` file inside the root directory, NGINX will serve that `index.html` file when a request is made to the corresponding directory URL.
>     

**HOW WE CAN ADD LOCATION in the current NGINX Configuration?**

Simply we can add the location block inside the server block. Let's make some changes.

Assuming we also want to showcase our Project inside the Blogging section since we have blogs for the same projects , which means that if someone reaches for [`http://localhost:8080/coding/`](http://localhost:8080/coding/) or [`http://localhost:8080/blogging/`](http://localhost:8080/coding/) they should see the same stuff.

For example you can update the nginx config and add the location block like below.

```nginx
http    {

    include mime.types;
    server  {
        listen  8080;
        root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;

        location /coding {
            root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
        }
        location /blogging {
            alias /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding;
        }
    }
}

events   {}
```

### `location /coding { ... }`

```nginx
location /coding {
    root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
}
```

* **Purpose**: This location block handles requests that start with `/coding`.
    
* **Behavior**:
    
    * When a request is made to a URI that starts with `/coding`, NGINX will look for files in the directory specified by the `root` directive.
        
    * The `root` directive in this context is set to `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample`.
        
    * This means that for a request to `/coding/example.txt`, NGINX will look for the file at `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding/example.txt`.
        
* **How it works**:
    
    * The `root` directive here sets the base directory for this location block.
        
    * The full path to the file is constructed by combining the `root` directory with the URI after `/coding`.
        
    
    For example, if you request [`http://localhost:8080/coding/file.txt`](http://localhost:8080/coding/file.txt), NGINX will serve the file from `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding/file.txt`.
    

### `location /blogging { ... }`

```nginx
location /blogging {
    alias /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding;
}
```

* **Purpose**: This location block handles requests that start with `/blogging`.
    
* **Behavior**:
    
    * When a request is made to a URI that starts with `/blogging`, NGINX will serve files from the directory specified by the `alias` directive.
        
    * The `alias` directive in this context is set to `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding`.
        
    * This means that for a request to `/blogging/example.txt`, NGINX will look for the file at `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding/example.txt`.
        
* **How it works**:
    
    * The `alias` directive is similar to `root` but serves files from the specified directory directly without appending the URI path.
        
    * The URI `/blogging/file.txt` will map directly to `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding/file.txt`.
        

### üëâ Key Differences Between `root` and `alias`

1. **Root Directive**:
    
    * The `root` directive appends the location pattern to the root directory path.
        
    * Example: If `location /coding` has `root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample`, the path to files will be `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding`.
        
2. **Alias Directive**:
    
    * The `alias` directive replaces the location pattern with the specified path.
        
    * Example: If `location /blogging` has `alias /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding`, the path to files will be `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding`, without appending the URI pattern.
        

After reload the NGINX , the result for both [`http://localhost:8080/coding/`](http://localhost:8080/coding/) or [`http://localhost:8080/blogging/`](http://localhost:8080/coding/)should look like below.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721577424387/e597532c-2b46-492b-b8a7-0e42493575d2.png align="center")

Now ?

What Happen if I create a `music` directory inside the `root` directory along side the `coding` directory, and instead of having a `index.html`, I created a `music.html`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721577826391/890ee4c4-6de5-44a2-a769-1d240921b5b8.png align="center")

now here we don't want to serve the `index.html` which is the default name that the nginx picks up , instead this time we want to server `music.html`. For this we can simply use the directive `try_files`.

```nginx
http    {

    include mime.types;
    server  {
        listen  8080;
        root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;

        location /coding {
            root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
        }
        location /blogging {
            alias /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding;
        }

        location /music {
            root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
            try_files   /music/music.html /index.html =404;
        }
    }
}

events   {}
```

### Explanation of the `location /music` Block

```nginx
nginxCopy codelocation /music {
    root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
    try_files /music/music.html /index.html =404;
}
```

#### **1.**`root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;`

* **Purpose**: Sets the base directory for serving files within this location block.
    
* **Behavior**:
    
    * For requests matching `/music`, NGINX will look for files in the directory `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/music` because the `root` directive specifies the base directory, and `/music` is appended to it.
        
    * For example, if a request is made to [`http://localhost:8080/music/track.mp3`](http://localhost:8080/music/track.mp3), NGINX will look for the file at `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/music/`[`track.mp`](http://track.mp)`3`.
        

#### **2.**`try_files /music/music.html /index.html =404;`

* **Purpose**: This directive attempts to serve different files based on the URI, in the specified order.
    
* **Behavior**:
    
    * `/music/music.html`: First, NGINX will try to serve the file `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/music/music.html`. This is a relative path based on the `root`directory combined with the URI path.
        
    * `/index.html`: If the first file is not found, NGINX will then try to serve `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/index.html` instead.
        
    * `=404`: If neither of the above files exists, NGINX will return a 404 Not Found error.
        
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1721578431705/853c2bd6-0efb-4b7c-a06c-2e552ee927bf.png align="center")
    

### üëâ How It Works

1. **Request Matching**: When a request is made to a URI starting with `/music`, this location block is used to handle it.
    
2. **File Lookup**:
    
    * For a request to [`http://localhost:8080/music/somefile.mp3`](http://localhost:8080/music/somefile.mp3), NGINX will look for the file at `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/music/`[`somefile.mp`](http://somefile.mp)`3`.
        
    * If the file is not found, NGINX will try to serve `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/music/music.html`.
        
    * If `music.html` is also not found, it will try to serve `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/index.html`.
        
    * If neither file is found, NGINX will return a 404 error.
        

### üëâ Key Points

* `root` Directive: Sets the base directory for serving files. In this case, it is `/Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample`, and `/music` is appended to it.
    
* `try_files` Directive: Attempts to serve a list of files in the specified order. It provides a fallback mechanism for handling requests if the primary file is not available.
    

# ü´µüèº Redirects and Rewrites

Let's say we want that if someone reaches out for [`http://localhost:8080/hobbies`](http://localhost:8080/hobbies) , they should be redirected to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/hobbies)`music` that we created above. This is easy , we just need to add a new location block.

```nginx
http    {

    include mime.types;
    server  {
        listen  8080;
        root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;

        location /coding {
            root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
        }
        location /blogging {
            alias /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample/coding;
        }

        location /music {
            root /Users/akshatsharma/Desktop/sample;
            try_files   /music/music.html /index.html =404;
        }
        location /hobbies {
            return 307 /music;
        }
    }
}

events   {}
```

### üëâ Explanation of the `location /hobbies` Block

```nginx
location /hobbies {
    return 307 /music;
}
```

#### **1.**`return 307 /music;`

* **Purpose**: This directive is used to send an HTTP redirect response to the client.
    
* **Behavior**:
    
    * `307`: This is the HTTP status code for a "Temporary Redirect." It indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URI. The client should repeat the request to the new URI, and the method (GET, POST, etc.) should be preserved.
        
    * `/music`: This is the target URI to which the client will be redirected. In this case, any request to `/hobbies`will be redirected to `/music`.
        

### üëâ How It Works

1. **Request Matching**: When a request is made to a URI starting with `/hobbies`, NGINX uses this location block to handle it.
    
2. **Redirect Behavior**:
    
    * For example, if a user requests [`http://localhost:8080/hobbies`](http://localhost:8080/hobbies), NGINX will respond with an HTTP 307 status code and redirect the client to [`http://localhost:8080/music`](http://localhost:8080/music).
        
    * The client will then make a new request to the `/music` URI.
        

### üëâ Key Points

* `return` Directive: This directive is used to send a specified HTTP response code and an optional text or URL. In this case, it's used to perform a redirect.
    
* `307 Temporary Redirect`: Indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to a different location (`/music` in this case). The client should use the new location for this request.
    

> You may notice that , even if you try going to [`http://localhost:8080/hobbies`](http://localhost:8080/hobbies) , it changes to [`http://localhost:8080/music`](http://localhost:8080/music) now if you want it to stay at `hobbies` but still serve the contents from `music` this can be done by changing introducing **REWRITE**

### üëâ Explanation of the `rewrite` Directive

```nginx
location /hobbies {
    rewrite ^/hobbies/?$ /music last;
}
```

#### **1.**`rewrite ^/hobbies/?$ /music last;`

* **Purpose**: Internally redirects the request from `/hobbies` to `/music` while keeping the URL in the client‚Äôs browser unchanged.
    
* **Components**:
    
    * `^/hobbies/?$`: This is a regular expression pattern that matches the URI `/hobbies`. The `?` after `/hobbies`makes the trailing slash optional.
        
    * `/music`: The new URI that the request will be internally rewritten to.
        
    * `last`: This flag tells NGINX to stop processing further `rewrite` directives and reprocess the request with the new URI. This flag ensures that the internal redirect is performed, and NGINX will handle the request as if it were originally made to `/music`.
        

> ### üëâ Purpose of Using `$`
> 
> * **Exact Matching**: Using `$` ensures that only exact matches for `/hobbies` (or `/hobbies/`) are considered. It prevents matching longer URIs that start with `/hobbies` but have additional characters or paths.
>     
> * **Precision**: It makes sure that the rewrite rule only applies when the entire URI is `/hobbies` or `/hobbies/`, and not when it includes additional segments like `/hobbies/extra`.
>     

### üëâ How It Works

1. **Request Matching**: When a request is made to a URI starting with `/hobbies`, NGINX uses this `location` block to handle it.
    
2. **Internal Rewrite**:
    
    * The `rewrite` directive will internally map the request for `/hobbies` to `/music`.
        
    * The client‚Äôs browser will still show the original URL `/hobbies`, but NGINX will serve the content from `/music`.
        

### üëâ Key Points

* `rewrite` Directive: Used to internally map or modify the request URI. It does not change the URL seen by the client.
    
* `last` Flag: Ensures that the rewrite is processed and the request is handled as if it was originally made to the new URI.
    

# ‚öñÔ∏è LOAD BALANCER

When we started this blog , we initially discussed that Nginx is useful while load balancing.

> **Load Balancing:** As the **user base increases**, a single server may **struggle** to handle all requests simultaneously, potentially causing a **bottleneck**. To mitigate this issue, multiple servers can be deployed. However, the critical question arises: **how does each request determine which server to target**? This is where **NGINX** plays a crucial role. Users interact solely with **NGINX**, which is responsible for **balancing the load** across the various servers by distributing incoming requests effectively.

For Understanding this we would be using 2 things.

1. Flask for backend
    
2. Docker for spinning up multiple instances of our application on multiple ports.
    

## ‚®ï Round Robin ?

**Round Robin** is a load balancing method used in NGINX to distribute incoming requests evenly across a set of backend servers. This ensures that each server in the pool gets an equal number of requests over time, helping to balance the load and avoid overloading a single server.

### üëâ How Round Robin Works

1. **Request Distribution**: NGINX maintains a list of backend servers and routes each incoming request to the next server in the list in a cyclic manner.
    
2. **Cyclic Order**: After sending a request to the last server in the list, NGINX returns to the first server and continues the cycle.
    
3. **Even Load**: Over time, this method ensures that each server receives roughly the same number of requests, which helps to distribute the load evenly.
    

### üëâ Example Configuration

Here‚Äôs an example of how you might configure round robin load balancing in NGINX:

```nginx
http {
    upstream myapp {
        server backend1.example.com;
        server backend2.example.com;
        server backend3.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://myapp;
        }
    }
}
```

### üëâ Explanation of the Configuration

1. `upstream myapp { ... }`:
    
    * Defines a group of backend servers. In this case, [`backend1.example.com`](http://backend1.example.com), [`backend2.example.com`](http://backend2.example.com), and [`backend3.example.com`](http://backend3.example.com) are part of the `myapp` group.
        
    * By default, NGINX will use round robin to distribute requests across these servers.
        
2. `proxy_pass`[`http://myapp`](http://myapp)`;`:
    
    * In the `server` block, the `proxy_pass` directive sends incoming requests to the `myapp` upstream group.
        
    * NGINX automatically distributes these requests using the round robin method.
        

### üëâ Benefits of Round Robin

* **Simplicity**: Round robin is simple to configure and understand. It does not require complex algorithms or additional settings.
    
* **Even Distribution**: It ensures that requests are evenly distributed among all available servers, helping to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
    

### üëâ Limitations

* **No Awareness of Server Load**: Round robin does not take into account the current load or performance of each server. It simply cycles through the list of servers.
    
* **Server Health**: If a server becomes unavailable, round robin will still attempt to send requests to it unless additional health checks or failover mechanisms are configured.
    

## üß™ How to Test This Setup

To set up and test a load balancer with Nginx, we'll need three things:

1. **Nginx Installed**
    
2. **Backend**: For this example, I'll use Flask.
    
3. **Docker**: This allows us to create multiple instances of the same application, which we can then distribute using round-robin load balancing.
    

### üëâ Setting Up a Simple Backend

First, create a simple [`main.py`](http://main.py) file in the same directory as your `index.html`. It's important to note that if we don't specify the directory for our HTML templates, Flask will default to looking for them in a directory named `templates`.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import os

curr_dir = os.getcwd()

app = Flask(__name__, template_folder=curr_dir)  # Specify your custom template folder

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

will also create a simple `requirements.txt` file that would have the python packages that are required for backend , right now it would just have

`Flask==2.0.2`

`Werkzeug==2.0.3`

### üëâ Creating a Docker file for creating a Docker image.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /sample

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /sample

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_ENV=development

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

### üëâ Creating A Docker Build.

To create a Docker image of your current application, run the command `docker build . -t roundrobin`. This command builds the Docker image and tags it with the name "roundrobin," as specified.

Once the build is complete, you can verify the image's creation by running the `docker images` command.

If you have the utility tool , you can verify the same above in the tool under images.

Once you are done with creating a docker image , you can spun 4 containers and forward the docker port to your local port using the following commands.

`docker run -p 5001:5000 -d roundrobin`

`docker run -p 5002:5000 -d roundrobin`

`docker run -p 5003:5000 -d roundrobin`

`docker run -p 5004:5000 -d roundrobin`

> ### üëâ Command Breakdown
> 
> `docker run`: This command starts a new container from a specified Docker image.
> 
> `-p <external-port>:<internal-port>`: This option maps a port on your host machine (the `<external-port>`) to a port inside the Docker container (the `<internal-port>`). This allows you to access the container's service from outside the container through the specified external port.
> 
> * `5001:5000`: Maps port 5001 on the host to port 5000 inside the container.
>     
> * `5002:5000`: Maps port 5002 on the host to port 5000 inside the container.
>     
> * `5003:5000`: Maps port 5003 on the host to port 5000 inside the container.
>     
> * `5004:5000`: Maps port 5004 on the host to port 5000 inside the container.
>     
> 
> `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode, which means the container runs in the background and does not block your terminal.
> 
> `roundrobin`: This is the name of the Docker image from which the container is created.

Once docker containers are you you can verify using the command `docker ps`

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND            CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
971d331e33ad   roundrobin   "python main.py"   6 seconds ago    Up 5 seconds    0.0.0.0:5004->5000/tcp   adoring_raman
0a58d8cd7594   roundrobin   "python main.py"   12 seconds ago   Up 11 seconds   0.0.0.0:5003->5000/tcp   frosty_chaplygin
2b15be3852c3   roundrobin   "python main.py"   17 seconds ago   Up 16 seconds   0.0.0.0:5002->5000/tcp   fervent_keldysh
f5edbc901877   roundrobin   "python main.py"   2 minutes ago    Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:5001->5000/tcp   eager_mccarthy
```

even in the browser you can check for [`http://localhost:5001`](http://localhost:5004) , [`http://localhost:5002`](http://localhost:5004), [`http://localhost:5003`](http://localhost:5004) , [`http://localhost:5004`](http://localhost:5004). These should be running the instance of same application on different ports.

### üëâ Making NGINX Changes for Round robin.

```nginx
http    {

    include mime.types;
    upstream backend {
        # Define backend servers
        server localhost:5001;
        server localhost:5002;
        server localhost:5003;
        server localhost:5004;
    }

    server {
        listen 8080;  # The port Nginx will listen on
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;  # Pass requests to the upstream group
        }
    }
}

events   {}
```

### `http` Block

This block defines the HTTP server configuration.

1. `include mime.types;`
    
    * This line tells Nginx to include a file called `mime.types`, which contains mappings of file extensions to MIME types. This helps Nginx serve files with the correct content type.
        
2. `upstream backend { ... }`
    
    * The `upstream` block defines a group of backend servers that Nginx can distribute requests to. In this case, it's named `backend`.
        
    * Inside this block, you list the servers that make up the `backend` group. Each `server` directive specifies a backend server, and here, it's configured to use four servers running on [`localhost`](http://localhost) with ports 5001 to 5004.
        

### `server` Block

This block defines a virtual server that Nginx will run.

1. `listen 8080;`
    
    * This line tells Nginx to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port 8080.
        
2. `location / { ... }`
    
    * The `location` block specifies how requests to a particular path should be handled. In this case, it‚Äôs handling all requests (since `/` matches everything).
        
    * `proxy_pass` [`http://backend`](http://backend)`;`
        
        * This directive forwards incoming requests to the upstream `backend` group. Nginx will distribute the requests among the servers defined in the `backend` block.
            

### `events` Block

The `events` block is used to configure settings related to Nginx‚Äôs event handling, such as the number of worker connections. It‚Äôs empty in your configuration, which means it will use default settings.

# YESSS You did it buddy!

In this article, we've explored the essential aspects of Nginx, from its role as a high-performance web server and reverse proxy to its powerful load-balancing capabilities. By configuring Nginx to manage incoming traffic and distribute it among backend servers, you can enhance the efficiency and reliability of your web applications.

The flexibility and speed of Nginx make it a valuable tool for a wide range of use cases, including serving static content, handling complex proxy setups, and balancing loads across multiple servers. As you become more familiar with Nginx, you'll discover even more ways to leverage its features to optimize your web infrastructure.
